Python errors
=============

If your program has an error, the error pane will appear at the bottom
left of the app.  It will give you the Python error message, and the
stack of locations in your program where the error occurred.

Errors can be:

syntax errors
   where your program is not correct Python syntax, and which prevent
   your program from even starting to run, or

runtime exceptions
   which can occur for many reasons, for example if you attempt to use
   an undefined variable, or divide by zero.

You should correct the error and try again to run your program.
