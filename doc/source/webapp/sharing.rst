Sharing a PyGgb program
=======================

You can use :menuselection:`File --> Share as link` to obtain a link
which you can share as you wish.  When someone clicks on the link,
PyGgb will create a copy of your program for them.

By default, the PyGgb program auto-runs when someone follows the link,
but you can disable this feature if you wish.

There is a limit to the size of program you can share this way, but
most sensibly-sized programs will work.
