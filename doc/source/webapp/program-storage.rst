Saving and loading programs
===========================

Storage is to browser-local storage, meaning it lives on the actual
device you are using.  You can use :menuselection:`File --> Download`
to obtain a copy of your program which you can do something more
permanent with.

Your program is saved frequently, but you can choose
:menuselection:`File --> Save now` if you would like to ensure your
work is saved.

To start a new program, choose :menuselection:`File --> New`, and give
your new program a name.

To open a previously-saved program, choose :menuselection:`File -->
Open`, select :guilabel:`My programs`, and choose from the list.

To run an example, choose :menuselection:`File --> Open`, select
:guilabel:`Examples`, and choose from the list.  If you would like to
change the example, you can use the :guilabel:`Make your own copy of
the program` button.
